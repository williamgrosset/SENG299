# SENG 299: Software Architecture & Design

Lab exercises from the class SENG 299: Software Architecture & Design (Summer 2016) at the University of Victoria.

### Background
This class was taken as an elective during the Summer 2016 semester. SENG 299 is a mandatory course for the Software Engineering program (optional for Computer Science). I was highly interested in these topics and had the opportunity to learn a vast amount about web development and design patterns. Overall, an amazing experience and I recommend other students at UVic to enroll in this course.
Individual final class grade: 93%
